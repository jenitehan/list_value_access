Example Drupal 7 module to provide access control on list field allowed values.

This has only been tested with checkboxes, other widgets may or may not work.

This module is for example purposes only, but if you want to use it simply replace all instances of "field_staff_access" with the name of your field. You'll probably want to update the permission strings as well.

A full version might be on the way! Please provide some feedback in the issue queue if you think it would be useful.
